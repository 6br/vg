# The VG tests are going to use toil-vg.
# toil-vg needs to be able to mount paths it can see into Docker containers.
# There's no good way to do that when running Docker containers as siblings of a container containing toil-vg.
# So we either have to genuinely nest Docker inside another Docker, or we have to run the build on the real host.
